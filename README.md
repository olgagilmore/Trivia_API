# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia - my project for Udacity Full Stack Developer nanodegree program

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out. 

1) Displays questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Deletes questions.
3) Adds questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Searches for questions based on a text query string.
5) Plays the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
